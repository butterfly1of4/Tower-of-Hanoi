#BRONZE: 
    An HTML page with 3 poles and 3 blocks. The blocks move from pole to pole as they are clicked (directed to). Each block should be programmed to move from one pole to another and they follow the rules of the game-i.e. no larger blocks on smaller blocks. Works well enough to make the game end when all the blocks are on the right pole. Rules and title basically laid out. All the logic is written.

#SILVER
    Add basic styling to the blocks. Include a "play again" option. Maybe event listeners for reinforcing the rules as the game is played. Add another block to the puzzle. Add some styling to the rules and title, like font and size, etc.

#GOLD
    All the pole are styled (skinny), and rounded at the top. The rules and title are styled even more to look uniform. Each block has rounded edges, and is skinny. Maybe add animation to make the block transitions look cooler.
